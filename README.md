# Algorithm Arena

A comprehensive repository for learning and visualizing sorting algorithms and data structures. This project provides interactive visualizations and implementations of classic algorithms to help understand how they work.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of popular sorting techniques (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- **Visual Demonstrations**: Step-by-step visualizations showing algorithm execution
- **Performance Metrics**: Compare time and space complexity across different algorithms
- **Interactive Examples**: Run algorithms with custom input data

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the visualization tool
4. Select an algorithm and watch it in action
